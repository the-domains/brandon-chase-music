Country music artist Brandon Chase is nothing shy of a miracle. Only a few days old, Brandon quit breathing 64 times in 12 hours and was told by doctors he could be deaf, blind, mentally impaired, or possibly all three. Not only did the Arlington, TX native not suffer any complications from his childhood, he instead went on to graduate high school at the age of 15\. He then completed his masters certificate in songwriting from Berklee College of Music at the age of 17\. Brandon taught himself how to play the piano and guitar and has been writing his own original music since the age of 14\. Brandon was featured on iTunes "New and Noteworthy" and also "Rising Stars of Country", following the release of his EP "Country Enough". His most recent achievement was appearing multiple times on season 5 of NBC's The Voice as a member of Blake Shelton's team. Brandon is currently recording his debut album set to release mid 2014\. The first single off the album, titled "One" (Currently featured on iTunes "New and Noteworthy"), is currently playing on Country Radio nationwide and is available for download on all digital platforms.
